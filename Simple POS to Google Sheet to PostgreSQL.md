# Simple POS to Google Sheet to PostgreSQL

## a. Possibility of making a POS app using Google Form

Yes, it's possible to create a point-of-sales (POS) app using Google Forms with scripts that generate order IDs/sales IDs and then transfer the data to a local PostgreSQL server. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

**1. Create a Google Form:**

- Set up the form with fields relevant to your POS system, such as customer name, product details, quantity, price, and total amount.

**2. Write a Google Apps Script:**

- Create a new Google Apps Script project associated with your form.
- Write a script that triggers when the form is submitted.
- In the script, generate a unique order ID/sales ID using a combination of timestamp and random numbers.
- Populate the form data with the generated ID and other relevant information.
- Store the data in a Google Sheet associated with the form.

**3. Set Up Google Sheet and PostgreSQL Connection:**

- Create a Google Sheet to store the form submissions.
- Install the PostgreSQL connector for Google Sheets, which allows you to connect the sheet to your local PostgreSQL server.
- Configure the connector with your PostgreSQL server details, including the host, port, database name, username, and password.

**4. Create a Trigger to Transfer Data:**

- Create a trigger in Google Apps Script that runs periodically (e.g., every hour) to transfer data from the Google Sheet to PostgreSQL.
- In the trigger script, use the PostgreSQL connector to query the Google Sheet for new data and insert it into the PostgreSQL database.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Validation:** Implement data validation in the Google Form to ensure that only valid data is entered.
- **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors that may occur during data transfer, such as network issues or database connection problems.
- **Security:** If dealing with sensitive customer or financial data, ensure that the data is securely transmitted and stored.
- **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of your solution as your business grows. If you anticipate a large volume of data, you may need to optimize the data transfer process or explore alternative database options.

By following these steps and addressing the additional considerations, you can create a functional POS app using Google Forms, Google Apps Script, and a local PostgreSQL server.

## b. Google Apps Script to create unique order ID

To generate a unique order ID/sales ID in your Google Apps Script, you can use a combination of timestamp and random numbers. Here's a sample script that you can adapt to your specific needs:

JavaScript

```
function generateOrderId() {
  // Get the current timestamp in milliseconds
  var timestamp = Date.now();

  // Generate a random 4-digit number
  var randomPart = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);

  // Combine the timestamp and random part
  var orderId = timestamp + "-" + randomPart;

  return orderId;
}
```

This script will generate an order ID in the format of `timestamp-randomPart`. For example, `1696284321987-3214`.

You can then call this function in your form submission trigger to generate a unique ID for each order:

JavaScript

```
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  var orderId = generateOrderId();
  // Update the form data with the generated order ID
  // ...
}
```

You can customize the format of the order ID by adjusting the timestamp and random part generation. For example, you could use a different date format or generate a longer random number.

Here are some additional tips for generating unique order IDs:

- **Avoid using sequential numbers:** Sequential numbers can be easily guessed or predicted.
- **Use a cryptographically secure random number generator:** This will ensure that the generated IDs are truly random.
- **Consider using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier):** UUIDs are 128-bit numbers that are guaranteed to be unique.
- **Store the generated IDs in a database:** This will prevent duplicate IDs from being generated.

By following these tips, you can create a reliable and secure system for generating unique order IDs in your POS app.

## c. Google Apps Script to trigger periodical data transfer from Sheets to PostgreSQL

## Transferring Data from Google Sheet to PostgreSQL with Google Apps Script

**Here's a Google Apps Script that triggers the transfer of data from a Google Sheet to a PostgreSQL database:**

JavaScript

```
function transferDataToPostgresql() {
  // Replace with your PostgreSQL connection details
  var conn = JdbcService.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://your_host:your_port/your_database", "your_username", "your_password");

  // Replace with your Google Sheet ID and range
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("your_sheet_id").getSheetByName("your_sheet_name");
  var dataRange = sheet.getRange("A2:Z"); // Adjust the range as needed

  // Get the data as a 2D array
  var data = dataRange.getValues();

  // Create a prepared statement to insert data into the PostgreSQL table
  var stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)");

  // Iterate through the data and set the values for each row
  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++) {
      stmt.setObject(j + 1, data[i][j]);
    }
    stmt.executeUpdate();
  }

  // Close the statement and connection
  stmt.close();
  conn.close();
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace connection details:** Replace `your_host`, `your_port`, `your_database`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual PostgreSQL connection information.
2. **Replace sheet ID and range:** Replace `your_sheet_id` and `your_sheet_name` with the ID and name of your Google Sheet. Adjust the `dataRange` to match the range of cells you want to transfer.
3. **Get data:** The script gets the data from the specified range as a 2D array.
4. **Create prepared statement:** A prepared statement is created to insert data into the PostgreSQL table. Replace `your_table` and `column1, column2, ...` with the name of your table and the corresponding column names.
5. **Iterate and insert:** The script iterates through the data and sets the values for each row in the prepared statement. Then, it executes the statement to insert the data into the database.
6. **Close resources:** Finally, the script closes the statement and the database connection.

**To trigger this script:**

1. Go to **Tools** > **Script editor** in your Google Sheet.
2. Paste the script into the editor.
3. Save the script.
4. Create a trigger: Go to **Edit** > **Current project's triggers**. Create a new trigger, select the function `transferDataToPostgresql`, and choose the desired trigger type (e.g., time-based).

This script will automatically transfer the data from your Google Sheet to your PostgreSQL database based on the trigger you set up.
